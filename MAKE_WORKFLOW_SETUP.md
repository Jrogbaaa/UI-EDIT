# Setting Up Your Make Workflow

This guide explains how to set up a Make (formerly Integromat) workflow to update your marketing results website.

## Overview

Each time your Make workflow runs, it will update the `data.json` file in your GitHub repository with the latest marketing results. The web app will then display this updated data automatically.

## Prerequisites

1. A Make.com account
2. A GitHub personal access token with repo permissions

## Setting Up the Make Workflow

### 1. Create a New Scenario

1. In Make, create a new scenario
2. Start with your trigger (whatever starts your marketing workflow)

### 2. Add a GitHub Module

1. Add a "GitHub" module
2. Choose "Update a File" as the action
3. Connect your GitHub account (you'll need your personal access token)
4. Configure as follows:
   - Repository Owner: `Jrogbaaa`
   - Repository Name: `UI-EDIT`
   - Branch: `main`
   - Path: `data.json`
   - Commit Message: "Update marketing results from Make workflow"
   - Content: Use the JSON template below, replacing values with your data

### 3. JSON Structure

Your JSON data should follow this structure:

```json
{
  "lastUpdated": "{{formatDate(now; YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss)}}Z",
  "title": "Marketing Workflow Results",
  "sections": [
    {
      "heading": "Campaign Overview",
      "content": "Your campaign overview text here"
    },
    {
      "heading": "Key Metrics",
      "content": "• Metric 1: {{value1}}\n• Metric 2: {{value2}}\n• Metric 3: {{value3}}"
    },
    {
      "heading": "Insights",
      "content": "Your insights text here"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Getting the File SHA

The first time you update the file, you'll need the file's SHA. To get it:

1. In the GitHub module, enable "Advanced Settings"
2. Add a new field "SHA of file being replaced"
3. To get the current SHA, add a GitHub module before this one:
   - Choose "Get File Content" as the action
   - Configure it with the same repository details
   - Path: `data.json`
4. Map the SHA from the "Get File Content" module to your "Update File" module

### 5. Testing

1. Run your scenario manually to test
2. Check your website at https://jrogbaaa.github.io/UI-EDIT/ to see the updates

## Example Make Workflow

1. Trigger (e.g., Google Sheet update, form submission, etc.)
2. Format your marketing data into the required JSON structure
3. Get the current file's SHA from GitHub
4. Update the file in GitHub with your new JSON data

## Troubleshooting

- If you get authentication errors, check your GitHub token
- If you get file not found errors, verify the repository and file path
- If the website doesn't update, check that your JSON matches the expected format
